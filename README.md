# Airbus Ship Detection

These notebooks detail my solution to Kaggle's [Airbus Ship Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection) challenge. This solution scored 139 out of 884 for the competition.

The goal of the competition is to analyze satellite images of container ships and produce segmentation masks of the ships.

The solution is broken up into several notebooks:
   * 0 Challenge overview and approach
   * 1 Preparing masks as images
   * 2 Training a segmentation model
   * 3 Training a classification model
   * 4 Generating a submission
